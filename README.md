# plannerApplication
create a daily planner schedule as an exercise in JQuery, Bootstrap and Javascript

With the planner, I can do the following things:
- have the current day displayed at the top
- have time blocks for standard business hours displayed
- have each time block color-coded to indicate past, present or future
- clicking in a time block will allow me to enter an event
- clicking a save button will save the event in local storage
- the saved events persist even when page is saved
